      <p>I built this application because I want to share how easy and accessible cooking can be!<br />The internet already has a lot of great websites to a lot of great recipes but navigating to find the right recipe can be tough. <br />This application helps with that by giving you an easy visual depiction of what recipes you can make! <br />You can make a lot of delicious things with just a couple of ingredients and it can be fun to improvise if you don't have an exact ingredient!<br />Start your cooking journey now by making an account and start filling your pantry!</p>
